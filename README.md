# Notch-Filter-For-Mirrorcle-MEMS-Drivers

# Problem Description:
MEMS scanners (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) are crucial in many applications. The speed and scanning angle of a MEMS scanner significantly influence its performance and applicability.
A specific type of MEMS scanner, operating with a smaller scanning angle but higher speed (MEMS-F), has been studied. This study showed that the operating frequency of these scanners can be divided into two regions:

## Operating Region Below the Damped Oscillator Frequency:
In this region, which lies below the system's natural oscillator frequency, the operation of the MEMS scanner is stable and does not endanger the physical integrity of the mirror.

## Operating Region Above the Oscillator Frequency:
When the operating frequency exceeds the natural oscillator frequency, it can lead to resonances that may damage or destroy the MEMS mirror. This poses a significant risk to the system's longevity and reliability.

To solve this problem, it was proposed to develop a notch filter for the MEMS driver. A notch filter is a band-stop filter that attenuates a specific frequency, in this case, the critical oscillator frequency. By implementing such a filter, the MEMS scanner can be prevented from entering the hazardous frequency range, thereby enhancing the system's safety and operational lifespan.
